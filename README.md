## Project info

PoliCode offers accessible local and regional information that is easy for citizens to read and understand. This information includes formulated, enacted, and/ or outcomes of laws and how they can potentially impact oneself. PoliCode offers translation and clarity about difficult, heavily academic-worded laws so citizens can understand what is happening, how it impacts them, and the next steps they can take. PoliCode offers an opportunity for those who were once restricted to stay informed. 
PoliCode is targeted at low-income,  black, and Latino communities. PoliCode strives to make awareness about laws accessible to those who may not have had a college degree or school experience. PoliCode is targeted at those whom the laws may most impact, but may have little awareness about. 
PoliCode is unique as it offers translation of laws, making it understandable and digestible to all citizens, no matter what level of education. PoliCode is designed to bring awareness about statutes that are most impactful depending on your state, city/town, district, zipcode, etc. PoliCode is an easy-to-use and unbiased platform providing accurate information. 
The goal of the website is to provide information about laws that are being enacted, formulated, implemented, evaluated, and how that impacts you on a level that is most digestible and understandable. PoliCode website showcases the most recent news, allows users to search specific types of policy, such as housing, education, policy, etc, and a specific location by entering zip code or address to see what policy is directly impacting you. This website allows community comments on specific articles and motivates citizens to stay informed about decisions made by elected officials in their local neighborhoods.
